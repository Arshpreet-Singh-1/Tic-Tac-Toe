# Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game using React.

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to play Tic-Tac-Toe in a web browser.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a friend or yourself.
- **History Tracking**: Track the history of moves and revisit previous game states.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects winning moves and announces the winner.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## ðŸš€ Code and Concept Explanation

- **React Components**: The game is built using React, with components such as `Square`, `Board`, and `Game` managing different aspects of the game interface and logic.
- **State Management**: React's `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the game, including the current board configuration, player turns, and game history.
- **Event Handling**: Event handling is used to capture player clicks on squares and update the game state accordingly.
- **Win Detection Algorithm**: A simple algorithm checks for winning combinations after each move to determine the winner.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The game interface conditionally renders different elements based on game state, such as showing the current player's turn or the winner of the game.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- React fundamentals, including component structure, state management, and event handling.
- Implementing basic game logic and user interfaces.
- Understanding the concept of conditional rendering and its application in building interactive web applications.
- Working with hooks like `useState` for managing state in functional components.
